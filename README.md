# cosmogrammatics

This is repo for for the cosmogrammatics website.

Testing out if the kirby CMS can be stretched to build what we need.

## Setup

You can use `devenv` to create a working shell environment dedicated to the project (with PHP, npm, etc) or simply install the belowed required software.

If going with devenv, simply start a new shell:

```
devenv shell
```

then follow the rest of the setup to setup Composer and npm.

- install PHP (>=7.4.0 <8.2.0) (check `composer.json`'s `require` field)
- install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

We fetch a copy of Kirby's plainkit (via zip download or git), eventually remove the previous `.git` folder, re-init git and start tracking our own history.

### Upgrade

To upgrade Kirby, run in a terminal the following:

```
composer update getkirby/cms
```

To upgrade everything (eg kirby and any other plugin), run:

```
composer update
```

We don't track the `kirby` folder into git, but instead handle it as a normal dependency.

## Run

Before running the server, make sure you have a content folder.

To run the backend, Kirby suggests to setup a full-on server environment (eg with nginx etc). This is not stricly necessary for the most part. So that you can simply run the backend by doing (from the root of the website folder):

```
php -S localhost:8000 kirby/router.php
```


If going with devenv, you can instead enter a new shell:

```
devenv shell
```

then run this devenv script:

```
run-server
```

which will run `php -S localhost:8000 kirby/router.php`.

Otherwise you can use something like [valet](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/valet) or anything else [listed here](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/setup/development-environment).

Check [Kirby's own guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/quickstart#requirements) as a reference.

## Frontend

When working on the js-side of the frontend (eg the article's commenting system), there's two npm scripts available:

- `npm run watch`: to run a local instance of the scripts; any change to any js files will trigger a new version of the final script output
- `npm run build`: to build a compressed, smaller version of the final js bundle
